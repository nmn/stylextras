description: Stylextras component wrappers for React Aria with StyleX-friendly props.
---

Stylextras ships a growing component library built on React Aria. Each component
is a thin wrapper that removes `className` and `style`, replacing them with a
StyleX `style` prop.

## Getting started
```tsx
import { Button } from '@/components/stylextras';

<Button>Press me</Button>
```
